## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- g++ / gcc:C++ Compiler (C++17 support needed)
- Python3 : Python Bindings / waf system
- cmake
- git


#### Network simulator 3 setup

#### MacOS
https://www.nsnam.org/docs/installation/html/macos.html

Follow the steps below to isntall and setup NS-3 on macOS

STEP ONE

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

using brew install the following 
`brew install gcc`  GNU Compiler Collection
`brew install python@3.11` (most recent versions will work as well)
Install the required libraries for Network Simulator

- sqlite:`brew install sqlite`
- libzml2:`brew install libxml2`
- NetAnim: `brew install qt@5`
- GNUplot: `brew install gnuplot`

While sqlite and libxml12 are not being used in out implementation. However, we are unsure of how not having them install may leave to inconsistencies. 

STEP 2

At this point you can choose what route you would like to take when installing NS3 you can choose to do git or __ version

GITHUB VERSION

Navigate to where you would like to install NS-3 to and then run.

`git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git`



#### Makefile setup

#### Project Structure 

### Clone the repository
