so in ns3 you will have 

ns-allinone-3.43
    - ns-3.43
        -scratch
            network-sim.cc
            CMakeLists.txt
            - subdir
                p2p-packet.h
                p2p-packet.cc
                p2p-application.h
                p2p-application.cc


CMakeLists.txt

I had to add these two lines to properly compile this in the line 67 
```
list(APPEND source_files ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/p2p/p2p-packet.cc)
list(APPEND source_files ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/p2p/p2p-application.cc)
```

network-sim.cc

where the actual sim is gonna occur , its a mess rn but i am just trying to test stuff
only file w a main. we eventually will need to do more work and figure out how we want to conenct
stuff but that is a later issue 

p2p-packet

i have defined a p2p packet with ping, pong, query and query hit
each packet is what we will be sending with diff feilds in its
very much wip but am doing it like this for now so we can get flooding first then modify

p2p-application

now that packet is semi working, its time to write the basic application stuff to attach
to each node. this will be routing and bahaviours (ex. if they recive a ping, send a pong)

eventially we will have the flooding done. this will be what we change when we do other ones


after initial compile and build i am just running this command 
ns-3.43 % ./ns3 build && ./ns3 run scratch/network-sim
and its been working good


note: i did have to update all my paths in c_cpp_properties.json as well as tasks.json 

current output 
starting sim
Node 0 IP: 10.1.1.1
Node 1 IP: 10.1.1.2
Node 2 IP: 10.1.1.3
Node 3 IP: 10.1.1.4
Node 4 IP: 10.1.1.5
test packet and serialization stuff 
Created packet: Type=0, MessageId=1234, SenderIP=10.1.1.1, TTL=5
Serialized packet size: 10 bytes
Deserialized packet: Type=0, MessageId=1234, SenderIP=10.1.1.1, TTL=5
starting simulation
simulation complete


next steps for tmr / wednesday 
1. define for (ping, pong, query, queryhit)
    . when nodes should send these
    . how to handle them
    . recieving bahaviour 
2. impliment packet handling in the p2p-application code
    . function to send and generae packets
    . function to recieve packets
    . function to process emssages
3. modify the netowrk-sim code to use this functionality and apply the application to the nodes
4. debug and test this stuff then we off
